The E-commerce project is a React-based application that simulates an online shopping experience. It features product listings, a shopping cart, and a checkout process. React’s component-driven approach allows for modular and reusable code, making it easy to manage the complex state and props needed for an e-commerce platform. This ensures a responsive and dynamic user interface, providing a seamless shopping experience for users.
